# OIFITS.jl

This is a special fork of OIFITS.jl made by Fabien Baron to use in OITOOLS.jl. Please refer to the documentation for the original OIFITS.jl, written by Éric Thiébaut, provided at https://github.com/emmt/OIFITS.jl.

Changes in this fork include:
* Tweaks to the format to enable reading the often non-format-compliant OIFITS files written by VLTI, NPOI, and CHARA instruments.
* Addition of closure amplitude quantities (mostly for research purpose at this stage)
